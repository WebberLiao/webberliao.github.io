## EAP AP (Enterprise Access Point)
- Purpose  
    EAP APs are designed for enterprise environments, providing robust and secure wireless connectivity for a large number of users and devices.
- Features
  - Security  
    EAP APs typically support advanced security protocols such as WPA2-Enterprise, 802.1X authentication, and RADIUS server integration.
  - Management  
    They often come with centralized management capabilities, allowing network administrators to manage multiple access points from a single interface.
  - Performance  
    EAP APs are optimized for high performance, supporting multiple SSIDs, VLANs, and Quality of Service (QoS) features to prioritize traffic.
  - Scalability  
    They are designed to handle a large number of simultaneous connections, making them suitable for environments like offices, schools, and public spaces.
- Deployment  
    EAP APs are typically deployed in a wired infrastructure, where each access point is connected to a network switch via Ethernet cables.

## Mesh AP (Mesh Access Point)
- Purpose  
  Mesh APs are designed to create a wireless mesh network, providing seamless coverage over a larger area without the need for extensive cabling.
- Features:
  - Self-Healing  
    Mesh networks can automatically reroute traffic if one node fails, ensuring continuous connectivity.
  - Easy Setup  
    Mesh APs are often easier to set up and expand, as they can connect wirelessly to each other, eliminating the need for Ethernet cabling between nodes.
  - Coverage  
    They are ideal for covering large or irregularly shaped areas, such as homes, campuses, or outdoor spaces, where traditional access points may struggle to provide consistent coverage.
  - Dynamic Routing  
    Mesh APs can dynamically choose the best path for data to travel, optimizing network performance.
- Deployment  
    Mesh APs are deployed in a decentralized manner, where each access point communicates with others wirelessly, forming a network that can be easily expanded by adding more nodes.
