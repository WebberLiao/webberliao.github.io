# LLDP
## lldpd
- CDP (Cisco Discovery Protocol)
    It is a proprietary protocol developed by Cisco Systems for discovering and identifying other Cisco devices on the network.
    It allows Cisco devices to advertise information about themselves, such as device ID, software version, platform, and the interfaces they are connected to.
    This information can be used to create a topology map of the network and identify the connectivity between Cisco devices.
- FDP (Foundry Discovery Protocol)
    FDP is a proprietary protocol developed by Foundry Networks (now part of Brocade/Broadcom) for discovering and identifying other Foundry devices on the network.
    It serves a similar purpose to CDP, allowing Foundry devices to advertise their information, such as device type, software version, and port information.
- EDP (Extreme Discovery Protocol)
    EDP is a proprietary protocol developed by Extreme Networks for discovering and identifying other Extreme devices on the network.
    It allows Extreme devices to advertise their information, including device type, software version, and port details

# L2TP
Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol  
L2TP is a tunneling protocol used to support virtual private networks (VPNs) and to carry data over the internet. It is often used in conjunction with other protocols, such as IPsec, to provide encryption and secure data transmission.
## Features
- Tunneling:  
    L2TP encapsulates data packets for transmission over a public network, creating a secure tunnel.
- Support for Multiple Protocols:  
    It can carry various types of network traffic, including PPP.
- No Encryption:  
    L2TP itself does not provide encryption; it relies on other protocols (like IPsec) for security.
- Widely Used:  
    It is commonly used for remote access and site-to-site VPNs.
