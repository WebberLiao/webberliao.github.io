# ACL
Access Control Lists
Primarily used for traffic filtering based on predefined rules on network devices.
An ACL is a set of rules that determine what traffic is allowed or denied on a network device, such as a router or a switch.
ACLs can filter traffic based on various criteria, including IP addresses, protocols, and port numbers.

## Types
- Standard ACLs: These filter traffic based solely on source IP addresses.
- Extended ACLs: These provide more granular control by allowing filtering based on source and destination IP addresses, protocols (TCP, UDP, ICMP), and port numbers.


# Firewall
Provide comprehensive security by monitoring and controlling traffic, often with advanced features.
A firewall is a security device or software that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.
Firewalls can be hardware-based, software-based, or a combination of both.

## Stateful vs. Stateless
- Stateless Firewalls: These make decisions based on individual packets without considering the state of the connection.
- Stateful Firewalls: These track the state of active connections and make decisions based on the context of the traffic.

## Advanced Features
Many firewalls offer additional features such as intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS), 
virtual private network (VPN) support, and application-layer filtering.
